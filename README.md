# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction in Taiwan

**Predicting Housing Prices in Taiwan: A Comparative Evaluation of Machine Learning Models**

This repository contains my MBA thesis project, which focuses on predicting housing prices in Taiwan using multiple machine learning models. The project evaluates and compares traditional and advanced ML techniques to identify the most effective approach for real estate price prediction.

## 📖 Project Overview

Accurate housing price prediction is essential for buyers, sellers, and policymakers. This project analyzes Taiwanese housing data and applies various machine learning models to predict property prices, comparing their performance based on standard regression metrics.

The study emphasizes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Practical insights for real-world real estate applications
